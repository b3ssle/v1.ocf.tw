  <p>“Internet of Things” (IoTs) has been broadly applied in various industries for decades.Civic IoTs is one of the fields practicing this technology. The concept of civic IoTs specifically refers to IoTs that mainly assist citizens by monitoring building safety, mitigating the impact of natural disasters, or helping farmers to detect the change of environments, etc. </p>
  <p>OCF is collaborating with groups around the world and Taiwanese businesses to help local communities install and operate open-source environmental sensors. We are sending waterboxes and airboxes from Taiwan to oversea communities and providing training on how to install and monitor the devices. These devices will generate open access data to empower communities to understand their local environment and how it is changing over time. </p>
  <p>OCF, via project “Civic Sense”,  is dedicated to encouraging more communities to adopt open-source sensors by  demonstrating the importance of civic IoTs and the influence of open access data. By applying open source design and development, the possibility of research, modification and redistribution of civic IoTs is maximized. Consequently Civic Sense accelerates  localization of civic IoTs to fit the local need and infrastructure availability.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the collaboration model in this project is committed to developing towards an "Inclusive Business Partnership". Through integrated collaboration, reaching bilateral complementation by the skills and resources exchanges among  commercial companies and NGOs, forming transformative relationship models and exerting influence to solve the key development challenges of our generation, thereby achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
  <p>We believe the power of international public-private collaboration will promote open source adaptation and increase environmental awareness. By promoting the collaboration between Taiwan manufacturers and open source communities, we expect to allow more global civic tech organizations to purchase sensors with reasonable prices.</p>

Unlike other local governors in Thailand who are centrally designated, the Bangkok City Government is one of the two cities in Thailand where the mayor is directly elected by citizens. When the current mayor took office, he stated that the electronic government would be his priority, and Taiwan's multiple electronic government platforms would be their reference examples. Current BMA also expresses the concept of " Open Bangkok '' as a main policy. Bangkok city government currently focuses on issues of public concern such as clean government, water management, road safety and street vendor control.</p>
