<ul>
  <li><strong>Research methods：</strong><br>The research adopted a qualitative approach to identifying key digital privacy issues for civil society actors  and exploring their advocacy efforts.<br>The selection of Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan as case studies stems from their diverging historical trajectories and socio-political environments. For Hong Kong, we adopted an alternative approach. Rather than interviewing specific organizations, we engaged with networks to understand how recent legislative changes have affected digital rights and privacy.<br>In terms of data collection, the research consists of questionnaires and interviews with targeted civil society actors  across the three case studies. 
        <ul>
        <li>Online questionnaire: We formulated a set of 15 questions to gather structured information on key digital privacy issues and advocacy strategies employed by a broad range of civil society actors, including representatives from human rights CSOs, scholars, independent activists and open-source community members. </li>
        <li>In-depth interviews:  The questionnaire phase provided preliminary information used to frame the focus of the research, while the in-depth interviews indicated ongoing concerns and trends from civil society actors’  perspectives, allowing us to identify common key concerns faced by local civil society actors .</li>
        </ul>
  In total, we collected data from 19 East Asian civil society actors, including 15 registered CSOs, 2 activist networks/communities, and 2 individuals across the three East Asian cases studied. The data comprises 18 valid questionnaires and 12 interviews. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>About Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong：</strong>In this report, we highlight the strategies employed for advocacy. The primary cases studied and their relevant issues in these three countries/area are：<strong>Taiwan：Electronic National Identification Card (eID) and National Health Insurance Data Sharing </strong><br>In Taiwan, advocacy challenges faced by civil society actors include varied stakeholder interests, inadequate privacy laws, low public awareness and technical hurdles. To address these challenges, civil society actors employ strategies such as litigation against policies that infringe on privacy rights and capitalize on public concerns regarding broader issues like national security for advocacy purposes.<br><strong>South Korea：Privacy Regulation Reforms, and Contact Tracing During COVID-19 Pandemic</strong><br>In South Korea, civil society actors face advocacy challenges such as low public awareness, government and corporate prioritization of interests over privacy rights, and reliance on digital technology that undermines privacy. In response, civil society actors have employed various strategies, including litigation, public sensitization efforts, and positioning themselves as recognized partners in policy discussions.<strong>Hong Kong：Use of Privacy Regulations Against Activists and Enhanced Surveillance</strong>In Hong Kong, CSOs and activists using digital tools face increasing risks of government surveillance and harassment as authoritarian measures grow. The National Security Law (NSL) allows the government to bypass data privacy regulations, significantly affecting CSOs. The NSL coupled with the enforcement of mass surveillance undermines privacy, yet ironically, the government also uses the privacy argument to shield itself from public scrutiny. The decline in freedoms has chilled CSO activities, halting direct advocacy. In response, CSOs have devised flexible strategies to cope with these political pressures.</li>
  <li><strong>Within these 19 civil society actors, we see… </strong></li>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Civil Society's Battle Against Governments’ Privacy Trade-offs in East Asia</strong><br>From the perspective of civil society actors, it appears that governments are willing to trade privacy rights for other benefits. These include several broad objectives such as: enhancing public service efficiency, as illustrated by the implementation of Taiwan's eID system; promoting economic growth, seen in South Korea's approach to leveraging pseudonymous information, and data closely related to the original collection purpose; and improving health research, evident in Taiwan's original push to expand the use of national health insurance data.</li>
        <li><strong>The Struggle for Digital Privacy Awareness in East Asia's Civic Sphere</strong><br>One major challenge shared by civil society actors across the three East Asian case studies lies in raising public awareness about digital privacy issues amidst the allure of digital applications and economic development. While national security and cybersecurity related incidents in Taiwan, such as the case of eIDs, have brought digital privacy concerns into the social spotlight, there remains insufficient public awareness around the importance of privacy as a fundamental human right.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Advocacy: Litigations and Interdisciplinary Collaborations</strong><br>interdisciplinary collaboration among civil society actors with backgrounds in technology and human rights. Such collaboration is crucial for advocating for digital privacy due to the issue's cross-disciplinary nature. It is, however, critical to understand that technological interventions should complement, not replace, institutional reforms.</li>
        </ul>  
</ul>

<p>As a CSO-initiated research effort, we acknowledge our limitations in addressing only a select few key issues and civil society actors for each East Asian case. Nonetheless, we believe that such an endeavor to generate knowledge about activism from civil society itself is crucial for advancing digital rights across the region. Despite the global nature of digital technology and the supposed universality of human rights, forging meaningful international alliances across civil societies remains a challenging task. Difficulties arise from the fact that civil society actors are rooted in locales with distinct legal, political, and linguistic backgrounds, creating significant barriers to mutual understanding and the search for common ground in advocacy. By generating evidence from the bottom-up, our research establishes an empirical foundation for future advocacy efforts across the region. The research process itself has also fostered new connections and opportunities among the civil society actors involved. We sincerely appreciate their participation, and we hope that our research effort can serve as a cornerstone for future partnerships.</p>

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Project Background </h2>
<p>In highly digitized societies, not only are the connections between our offline and online lives increasingly dense, the amount of time we spend living online is also increasing. Whether our rights are protected online is highly dependent on the type of digital services and standards set by big corporations. As private entities, many corporations have the ability to control large social media platforms and communication services. It could be said that they have become the protectors of the public sphere in the digital era, able to decide user’s access to freedom of information and speech. In addition, such corporations have access to large amounts of digital trace data on users and can thus make large profit through utilizing and sharing this large scale data. Their influence on our personal privacy can thus not be understated.
</p>
<p>In recent years, public scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and their inappropriate use of personal information have made both governments and consumers increasingly aware of the responsibility of corporations to protect our personal information and freedoms of speech. Big digital players like Google and Facebook have already been pressured into committing to improve their internal governance, to make their policies more transparent, and to ensure that other corporations also protect human rights. Many countries in Europe and the Americas have continued to produce new legislation relating to this issue, such as America’s proposed Federal Online Privacy Act or the European Union’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR. These laws all increase the responsibility of corporations to protect digital human rights. For example, by making them formally evaluate their influence over personal data protection, and requiring them to strengthen their systems for reporting personal data breaches. GDPR extended such responsibilities to all private foreign companies providing services and products to EU citizens. In Taiwan, in addition to the frequent reports of how digital services have eroded our personal privacy, in recent years, more attention has been paid to the potential threat that Chinese investments in corporations pose to the protection of our freedom of speech. The “digital human rights'' conference held in January 2022 that was co-hosted by the National Human Rights Council, Taiwan (國家人權委員會) and the Digital Trade and Data Protection Assocation (中華民國數位金融交易暨資料保護協會)  further highlighted the serious challenge that private industry poses to our human rights. Because of this, the question of how to protect human rights in the digital age is a key concern for both consumers and the government alike.
</p>
<p>OCF's core value is to promote open tech, and by doing so, protect human rights in the digital age and ensure internet freedom. OCF’s existing projects already include many efforts to promote open source innovation to a larger public, and to promote open data to the government. When dealing with private corporations, what action should we take? We believe that working with our global partners and private corporations, we should work to promote transparency as to how digital platforms and services are protecting our human rights and promote a positive environment of competition and accountability. Due to a lack of information on how corporations are protecting our rights in Taiwan, OCF has started to use an international standard to produce new data. We will use this data as part of our future activism, and also as a way to connect Taiwan to the rest of the world, making sure we take our seat at the table of digital human rights discussion.
</p>


<h2 class="ui dividing header">Project Description</h2>
<p> Ranking Digital Rights ，RDR is an international evaluation tool developed by the American public think tank New America Foundation. They want to create a standardized system to measure the extent to which corporations in every country are protecting digital human rights during their operation and service provision to consumers. There are already participants in the RDR system from many places where transnational corporations are operating, including locations in the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia. Many participating corporations participate every year and try each time to achieve a higher ranking as a way to prove their dedication to protecting digital human rights. The types of corporations included are divided into the two groups: (1) Digital platforms and (2) Telecommunications companies
</p>

<img src="/p/rdr/countries_en.jpeg" class="ui rounded image">

<p>In 2022, RDR hopes to expand participation among corporations in East Asia. RDR has begun collaborating with three NGOs concerned with digital development: Digital Asia Hub, OCF and Open Net Korea. They are now looking for local corporations in Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea to evaluate using the RDR system. The evaluation includes three main critera of digital human rights: governance, privacy, and freedom of speech. The evaluation focuses on reviewing the corporations’ work processes and internal policy documents to assess whether they include substantial consideration of digital human rights. OCF is mainly involved in the localization of RDR’s research methods and in collaborating with Taiwanese corporations to produce a standardized evaluation system for corporations’ protection of human rights. Due to the uniqueness of Taiwan’s geo-political status, being both a democratic state deeply ingrained within international trade networks whilst also being at constract threat of economic and political coercion by China, OCF and other Taiwanese civil society groups, experts, corporations are working together to consider how to incorporate considerations of Taiwan’s unique position into the standardized international methodology created by RDR to ensure we produce a meaningful evaluation of the digital human rights records of Taiwanese corporations.
</p>

<h2 class="ui dividing header"> Plan of Implementation</h2>
<p>This project is split into five stages. OCF will localize RDR evaluation tools and consider how to address Taiwan’s unique political environment. We will work with NGO’s and share our experience to collaboratively produce a research plan and select Taiwanese corporations with significant influence over digital human rights to evaluate. We will collaborate with the corporations and ask them to provide their policy documents, which OCF will then use these documents and RDR’s standards to produce a digital human rights report and list of suggestions for these corporations. We will also report our findings to our NGO partners and the government, thus planting a firm base for the development of digital human rights in Taiwan.  
</p>

<img src="/p/rdr/flow_en.jpeg" class="ui rounded image">

<h2 class="ui dividing header">Expected Results </h2>
<p>We hope that by collecting and releasing quantitative data on corporations digital human rights practices, the government, consumers and civil society groups can all better understand the current status of corporate human rights protections and use this information to inform policy decisions. The government will be able to better understand the corporate landscape and establish appropriate norms for digital human rights protections. Consumers will be able to more consciously choose the corporations who best protect their rights, and civil society groups will be able to use this information to engage in all forms of advocacy and activism. At the same time, the corporations themselves will be able to use the results of the evaluation to develop a business model that better protects digital human rights, which will therefore help increase accountability across our digital landscape.

<h2 class="ui dividing header">We are Recruiting Corporations in Taiwan!
</h2>

<p>OCF is currently recruiting corporate partners to join in with RDR. Corporate partners not only receive a report on their digital human rights records, but will also be placed on a ranking alongside globally well known business, thus boosting their international visibility. In addition, RDR’s report can be used by corporations to produce their own corporate social responsibility reports or corporate sustainable development reports.
