        title: Did you have a good 2021?
        description: OCF was born in 2014, so we’re turning 8 this year! After two years of the pandemic, we’ve got used to working at home and ordering take out. We have also become more reliant on technology to maintain our connections to others. The seedlings we planted before the pandemic had already started sprouting. Amidst the ongoing public health emergency and the urgent need to speed up our digital transformation, we hope that our open source sprouts can continue to grow stronger and more robust.<br>OCF is an organization that supports Taiwan’s tech communities and promotes open tech to help create a healthier digital ecosystem for all. By focusing on core infrastructures behind digital systems, we hope to build a safer and more equitable world for all.<br>This year's theme is “digital forest”. Although there has been growing awareness about digital human rights, OCF believes that it is crucial to focus on “open tech” as the root of internet and social design. We dedicate ourselves in open tech by promoting open source, open data and open government.

    description: Technology is a double-edged sword. With every new technology developed, our rights could face a new threat. OCF promotes and creates channels of dialogue between government bodies, civil society organizations and tech groups. We hope to be the bridge between these groups. We also hope to connect Taiwan and the reset of the world, so that we can collectively realize the potential of openness and open source to address the challenges we are collectively facing. We also promote Taiwanese civil society’s awareness of digital tools that can be at disposal for preparing to enter an increasingly digitized future.<br>Current 5g technology has reversed the closed paradigm that has dominated the development of communication technology. Open RAN is promoting openness in internet design, and has broken the previous model of architecture development as determined by behemoth corporatives.<br>In order to make Taiwanese business and academics more aware of international open source projects in this area, OCF worked with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and inivted international partners from the O-RAN alliance to discuss their experience of international collaboration, as well as the current landscape and trends of global telecoms operators in Open Ran and their experience in incorporating open source into 5g.

        description: Although digital technology makes our life more convenient, it has also brought with it worries of personal information leaks, privacy infringement, public opinion manipulation, and disinformation. Especially since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of preventive measures, it has become easier for authorities to get hold of personal data. It is thus more crucial than ever to pay attention to protecting our digital human rights.

    description: Our world is increasingly infused with digital technology. Whether it be code, information and data, materials inscribed with our history and culture can all be shared and brought together through digital technology.<br>If “open and transparent” can be turned into a habit, collaboration and sharing can then become the basis for activism amongst civil society. If that truly happens, we would be able to break down the divides between different groups of people and help spread knowledge more easily and effectively.<br>In 2021, OCF was not pushed back by the pandemic. We continued to find ways to reach broader audiences through news articles, lecture series and educational courses in order to make more people aware that open culture and cultural openness can truly have a positive impact on society.<br>The impact of free and open source technology is large and it continues to remain deeply integral to our daily lives. OCF is continuing to support the promotion of open source and open culture in a range of fields. This includes our project “Open Source Newbies” which introduces those unfamiliar with open source to the community; The Openists, a space for all times of technical knowledge sharing, our 5G Open RAN project and many others. In total, we hosted over 20 events with a total of over 800 participants, allowing people to engage with open source through many different channels.

In Taiwan, we promote open government, open source, and support local tech communities whilst also building international bridges. We need everyone’s support to help foster open culture as it continues to take root. We look forward to working together to prepare for our rapidly changing world, and improve our lives and avoid the potential dangers of technology. We believe that open souce and open culture can protect privacy, promote freedom and put an end to monopolies of power and resources. In short, open source ensures that no person is an island.
