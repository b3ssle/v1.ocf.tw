        subtitle: 
        description: In the open source community, there is always a group of people who don’t seek for entertainment  after work but code tirelessly, only to improve the open source code and open data applications, then find their own sense of accomplishment. There is always a group of people willing to share online what they learn today with the spirit of self-participation, self-learning and co-working. Members of open culture communities are exactly this kind of people. The OCF administrative team is not only caring and assisting communities, but also growing with them.

        subtitle: 
        description: OCF has long been concerned with open government and open data. In the landmark international conferences of OGP and IODC this year, we saw the influence and change brought by open culture and open source, in the area of economic development and anti-corruption. In practice, the key for civic tech in Taiwan to continue to thrive depends on the collaboration between government and citizens and how they create open, stable data platforms.
