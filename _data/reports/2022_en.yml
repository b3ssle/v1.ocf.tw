        description: After two gloomy years, 2022 marks the silver lining of the pandemic. Aside from the physical conferences, community events are also reviving. However, communities and organizers now face the challenges of hybrid events, staff changes, and people’s tendency to stay at home. How should contributors run communities in the post-pandemic time? In December 2022, we held a one-day workshop with 50 members from 20 communities to exchange past experiences and discuss future collaborations in the upcoming 2023.

This year, we represented civic communities to issue the very first cosignatory on the launch of the Ministry of Digital Affairs. The consignatory was brought to the ministry’s notice. In a follow-up public hearing, Minister Audrey Tang answered up to 40 queries vis-à-vis the civic communities.<br>In addition, regarding the controversial draft of the Digital Intermediary Services Act, OCF has held 4 online/offline workshops with the communities. Aside from discussing the draft in detail, we also introduced the digital service supervision policies in different countries. We hope to build the public’s consensus on Taiwan’s platform governance in the near future.<br>Along with the above actions, we also continued to participate in digital human rights advocacies in Taiwan, which include the Interpretation of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), legal amendments of digital ID cards (eID), and many more. We provide tech support and actively take a stand in these advocacies.

        description: In this digitalized time, content moderation and large-scale personal data collection by online platforms have contaminated people’s privacy and freedom of speech. This year, OCF kicked off the “Ranking Digital Rights'' project in Taiwan. We evaluated the digital human rights performances of 20 major digital cooperations/services and would publish our first report in 2023. Through transparent data, we aim to point out the weakness of the enterprises’ policies, call for improvements, and increase the public’s awareness of their own rights.

For instance, the open government meetup of indigenous people. Furthermore, through the invitation of the National Democratic Institute, OCF attended the Copenhagen Democracy Summit to exchange thoughts on the execution of the open government plan around the globe.<br>In the Open Government/Parliament committee held by the Administrative and Legislative Yuan, OCF staff have participated as OP-MSF (Open Parliament Multistakeholder Forum) members and expanded the discussions into public scenarios. Through brainstorming with different stakeholders, we successfully maintain and inspect Taiwan's open government.<br>OCF held collaboration workshops to revise the workflow and organization of the Open Parliament stakeholders. We also published an integrated report on Taiwan’s Open Parliament Action Plan in 2022 to improve the efficiency of public-private collaborations.

        description: Compared to the rest of the world, Taiwan’s Internet is relatively free from excessive moderation and regulation. However, in a modern society that operates heavily on all kinds of digital devices, we could not be more conscious about Internet freedom and digital rights.<br>OCF has continued to hold Internet Freedom Monthly Meetups with our fellow communities this year. Moreover, in collaboration with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada, we also held divergent events such as film festivals. We discussed Internet unfreedom through topics including China’s Great Firewall, Hong Kong’s Leave Home Safe, DNS blocking, etc. Tapping into the future of the Internet, we also investigated issues such as online sexual violence, gender misogyny, Internet infrastructure during the war, methods to implement data trust, and the Digital Intermediary Services Act. These monthly meetups facilitate our vision of Internet freedom.

        description: The power of the Internet has been significantly boosted in the post-pandemic time. Aside from telecommunication and online shopping, remote working and cloud services also enter the mainstream. OCF has been keen on digital human rights and Internet freedom. In order to nurture a vigorous digital society, we actively serve as initiators and service providers.<br>In 2022, OCF carried out our mission through three accomplishments, which are hands-on workshops, a digital defense playbook, and malicious flow detection. The hands-on workshops aim to train capacity in building safe Internet structures. We published a playbook on open source services and Internet structures, and built an open source meeting platform to secure the safety of NGO workers. The seminar observations were demonstrated in SITCON and COSCUP.<br>We wish to secure a safe digital space with our global partners from different fields. Based on this strong ally, we would then reach out to fellow organizations with high risks of cyber attacks. Through malicious flow detection, we would check if any malware has stolen confidential data from their main phones and computers. Through these three key projects, OCF aims to bridge the gap between technologies and civic communities.

        description: Aside from putting up physical booths at major open source conferences, OCF is dedicated to promoting open culture in various ways. However, open source and culture could be hard to understand since  the general public is unfamiliar with programming, open source and culture could be hard to understand. In order to break down the barrier, OCF has developed a board game entitled “OpenStarTerVillage” with our volunteers, and hosted 2 workshops and 1 in-class tutorial in 2022. Through this accessible game, the general public gets an overview of open source, open data, and open government through solid cases. Accordingly, they could discover their unique roles in these domestic and global open source projects. We are confident that OpenStarTerVillage is a fun space to start off the journey in open culture for the general public.

        description: From 2022, international conferences started rolling again as the pandemic subsides. In response, we relaunched the Support Program for International Conference Participation in March. The revised program covers pre-sessions, funding, and program FAQ, which sufficiently support youngsters and full-time workers to participate in international conferences. To expand tech communities’ interests in the international conferences and global affairs, OCF also hosted 2 panels and booths at COSCUP and SITCON. There were over 100 participants who took part in the events to get globally involved.<br>By the end of 2022, OCF has supported 1 contributor and 3 attendees to participate in RightsCon and Code for Latin America online. We held 1 public sharing after each conference, and over 30 participants engaged in our discussions. All field notes of the international conferences were made public on the program website in the notion of knowledge sharing. Their sharings have expanded our knowledge base and nurtured new contributors for the reopening physical conferences.

To preserve the warm tradition of “veteran-led community orientations,” this year, we continued to run the “Open Source Newbies” project through sessions at COSCUP, the largest open source annual conference in Taiwan. The sessions covered eight themes related to open culture and tech, introducing those unfamiliar with the topics to the community. In total, over 400 participants joined the sessions.

The interns could learn about open tech and open culture, not only from OCF's works but also from these communities. In 2022, we had 17 university students participating in the OCF & community internship program.
