        title: The Origin of Open Culture
        description: The idea of open culture was born from the open source movement. The movement advocates that the source code of software should be open and allow people to access freely. As the movement moves forward, its spirit of openness, transparency, and accessibility have been applied to formations of file formats, digitalization of various kinds of data, and work processes of industries and organizations. <br><b>We believe openness makes the world better.<br>We strive to establish the foundation of open source culture.<br>We value the culture and development of open source and technology communities.</b><br><a href="https://ocf.tw/en/" target=_blank>Learn more about open culture </a>

    description: Open Culture Foundation (OCF) was founded with the support of many open source and technology communities. Therefore, since its founding, OCF’s most important mission is to serve as a stable fiscal sponsor to projects initiated by open source and technology communities. By doing so, OCF is able to provide stable and systematic administrative and fiscal support to various open source and technology communities. <br>In 2020, OCF has supported 34 projects initiated by communities. Through fiscal sponsorship, OCF is able to support open and technology communities without legal entity status, facilitate their growth, and make them influential.<br>Rather than becoming an organization initiating massive and various tasks, OCF expects itself to focus on establishing a healthy environment that connects more communities to care about issues or causes and start more projects.

        description: Running a community requires a lot of work, including hiring, contracts, tax, and dealing with accounting and fiscal affairs. Most of the community members are students or employees at the same time, so the above work could be a huge burden. Moreover, some parts of the work can’t be done without a legal entity. Addressing this problem, OCF is here to assist communities in administrative works.

    description: What is open culture? People always ask this question when they know OCF for their first time.<br>Open culture is about how to make “open” as a kind of culture that inspires and accelerates exchanges of ideas between different communities and disciplines. For instance, governments and civil society will be able to find the model of exchange and collaboration when open culture is shared in these two different communities. With the help of technology, they can broaden their copperations in more areas, such as source code and data.<br>OCF strives to let more people learn the importance of open culture - it makes human achievements shared by all human beings instead of being controlled by a specific group under this ever-changing digital era. <br>OCF also aims to help people to understand what “open technology” is, and thereby realizing what impact human beings will encounter when technology is inaccessible and closed. Based on that, OCF can encounrage people to imagine what a free and shared digtial technology environment could be like.
